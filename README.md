# Grocery Bud

This is a simple react CRUD application where the user will be able to add, update and delete groceries in the list. If the user wants, he/she can delete groceries one by one, or all the groceries at once also.

This website also has the feature of localstorage which means if the user close the tab after adding some items to the grocery list and then reopen it again, or reload the browser, then, all the items added by the user will not get removed, it will stay as it is.
